# Overview


This is a simple Angular Task Tracker project that I created so that I can learn more about Angular as a framework as well as TypeScript. It includes components,services, and a fake Rest backend to demonstrate the basics of how Angular works.


This Web App has two simple screens. On the home page, a user can add a task to their list, remove a task, and modify a task. The project has an about page that give the information about the app and allows the user to navigate back to the home screen.

This is a simple way to manage my todo list.
